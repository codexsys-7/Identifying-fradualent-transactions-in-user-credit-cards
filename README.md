In this project, I built a **credit card fraud detection system** using **machine learning algorithms** to classify transactions as **fraudulent or legitimate**. The dataset, consisting of **10,000+ user transactions**, contained various features related to **purchasing patterns, transaction amounts, and timestamps**.  

Using **feature engineering and preprocessing**, I explored the data to detect anomalies in user behavior. I then applied **various ML models** such as **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost**, optimizing them through **hyperparameter tuning**. Model performance was evaluated using **accuracy, precision-recall, and F1-score**, ensuring a balance between **fraud detection and minimizing false positives**.  

This project highlights the **importance of data-driven fraud detection** in financial security, showcasing my skills in **data analysis, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection** to improve transaction security.
